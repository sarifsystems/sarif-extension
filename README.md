sarif-extension
===============

This is a browser WebExtension for [sarif](http://github.com/sarifsystems/sarif),
an experimental personal assistant and data analysis platform. Currently, it
only tracks browsing habits and submits all visited URLs over WebSocket to
sarif, and it is up to the user to further store/process the data. It should
work in Firefox 48+, but may also work in Google Chrome.
